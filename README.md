	
For this lab, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to the Vue apps we have already built so far. You must create your own original work. Your creative projects can build on each other.

## Pair Programming
You are welcome to use pair programming for this assignment. With pair programming,  two students work together at one workstation. One takes the role of the "driver" and writes code while the other takes the role of the "observer" to review each line of code as it is typed in and offer suggestions. The two students switch roles frequently during the project. The two students should have relatively equal levels of experience.

Pair programming is not assigning different parts of the project to two different people, and then meeting later to put the work together. You should follow the above guidelines for pair programming to create a better learning experience.

## Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

The site uses Vue and the Vue CLI
The site has at least three pages
The site has some mock data that is at least as detailed as the mock data used in the prior lab.
The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account and should be a public repository.

## Submission
Please submit to Canvas the URL for your web server, where your code is running (e.g. on your DigitalOcean server). On this website, in a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository. Use a unique URL for the project, e.g. cp3.emmasmith.org.

If you worked with a pair programming partner, both of you should submit the assignment and both of you should list the other person's name in the website footer and in the assignment submission.

## Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

- you used Vue and the Vue CLI for the entire site
- you have three pages
- you have detailed mock data
- how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.

TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

- 90-100: Excellent use of Vue, clearly follows web design principles
- 80-90: Uses Vue, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
- 70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue, but does not make a strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles
